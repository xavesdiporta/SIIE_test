📖 Clan Progress Tracker

📌 About the Project
Clan Progress Tracker is a web platform designed to support and monitor the personal development journey of each member of a Caminheiros Clan within the Corpo Nacional de Escutas (CNE), the Portuguese Catholic Scouting Association.

This tool aims to centralize and organize each Caminheiro’s progression, marking completed challenges, goals, and milestones as part of the CNE Progression System — including key stages such as Compromisso de Honra, Caminhada, and Partida.

📝 Allow members to record completed challenges and future goals.

📊 Provide an overview for the clan leadership to easily monitor the progress of all members.

📚 Serve as a digital support and archive for personal and collective development journeys.

🌱 Why This Project
Caminheiros from different clans often lack a centralized and accessible digital tool to manage and reflect upon their personal scouting journey. This project was created to fill that gap, offering a modern, clean, and organized platform for both Caminheiros and clan leaders.
